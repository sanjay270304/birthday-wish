            Happy Birthday to the one who means the
            world to me.
            I don't think I'll ever have
            the right words to fully express how much you mean to me-but I'1l try anyway.
            <br />Thank you..,<br />
            Thank
            you for showing up in my life and
            staying. For the love, the late-night talks, the
            silent understanding, and even the difficult conversations. Thank
            you for being real with me, for seeing
            me when I felt low, and for reminding
            me that I matter.
            You've been my calm in the chaos, my
            steady when everything else feels shaky. You've taught
            me that love doesn't always come with fireworks-it
            can also be quiet, patient, and steady. And that's exactly what you've been for me.
            You're not
            just someone I care about-you're the person who
            changed the way I see the world, and
            myself.
            So today, I hope you feel just a
            fraction of the love you've given me. You
            deserve that and so much more. I hope
            this year brings you peace, joy, and everything
            you've quietly wished for when no one was
            listening.
            Happy Birthday Darling. I'm so lucky I get to
            say I know you. And even luckier that
            I get to love you..
